# Parallel Implementation Strategy

This document breaks down the ChirpStack Provisioning implementation tasks for parallel execution by up to 5 coding agents working simultaneously and asynchronously.

## Overview

The implementation is organized into **5 workstreams** that can be executed in parallel with minimal dependencies. Each workstream is assigned to one agent and focuses on a distinct area of functionality.

## Agent Assignments

## Coordination & Integration

### Shared Interfaces

To work in parallel, agents must agree on interfaces:

1. **Loader Interface** (Agent 2 â†’ Agents 4, 5):
   ```python
   def load_setup(file_path: Path) -> dict
   def load_devices(file_path: Path) -> Generator[dict, None, None]
   ```

2. **Client Interface** (Agent 3 â†’ Agents 4, 5):
   ```python
   def list_tenants() -> List[Tenant]
   def get_tenant(name: str) -> Optional[Tenant]
   # Similar for other entities
   ```

3. **Diff Interface** (Agent 4 â†’ Agent 5):
   ```python
   def calculate_diff(desired: State, current: State) -> DiffResult
   def format_diff(diff: DiffResult) -> str  # Rich output
   ```

### Integration Points

**Week 1:**
- Agent 1: Delivers schemas (used by Agent 2 for validation)

**Week 2:**
- Agent 2: Delivers loaders (used by Agents 4, 5)
- Agent 3: Delivers basic client (used by Agent 4)

**Week 3:**
- Agent 4: Delivers diff engine (used by Agent 5)
- Agent 3: Completes client (used by Agent 5)

**Week 4:**
- Agent 5: Integrates everything into CLI and provisioner

### Communication Protocol

1. **Define interfaces first**: Each agent creates interface stubs in Week 1
2. **Use mocks during development**: Agents can mock dependencies
3. **Integration testing**: Week 4-5, all agents collaborate on E2E tests
4. **Code reviews**: Cross-agent reviews to ensure compatibility

## Sequential vs Parallel Tasks

### Must Be Sequential
- Agent 1 â†’ Agent 2 (schemas needed for validation)
- Agent 3 â†’ Agent 4 (client needed for current state)
- Agent 4 â†’ Agent 5 (diff needed for CLI)

### Can Be Parallel
- Agent 1 (schemas) parallel with Agent 3 (client)
- Agent 2 (loaders) parallel with Agent 3 (client)
- Agent 4 (diff) can start once Agent 2 and 3 are partially complete

## Timeline Summary

| Week | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Agent 3 | Agent 4 | Agent 5 |
|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 1    | Schemas, Config | Core loaders | Client infra | (waiting) | (waiting) |
| 2    | Enhanced validation | CSV, validator | Entity clients | Diff calculator | (waiting) |
| 3    | Testing, docs | Testing | Testing | Rich output | Provisioner |
| 4    | Support | Support | Support | Testing | CLI |
| 5    | Integration | Integration | Integration | Integration | Integration |

## Future Work (Not Parallelized)

After parallel implementation:

- **Export/Backup** (Agent 5): Reverse direction - read from server, write to files
- **Integration Tests** (All agents): E2E tests with real ChirpStack Docker container
- **Advanced Features**: State management, progress reporting, TOML/YAML support

## Success Criteria

Each agent should:
- âœ… Deliver working code with tests (>80% coverage)
- âœ… Pass `ruff check` and `ruff format` with no violations
- âœ… Make atomic commits (one feature per commit)
- âœ… Document interfaces and usage
- âœ… Handle errors gracefully with informative messages
- âœ… Support large files (50,000+ lines) efficiently

Final integration:
- âœ… All modules work together seamlessly
- âœ… CLI accepts all required flags
- âœ… Dry-run shows correct diff without making changes
- âœ… Provisioning works end-to-end with real ChirpStack server
- âœ… All tests pass
